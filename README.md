# PopArtWeather

This project is a react app that uses coordinates to provide the user a forecast for a precise location.

## How Does it Work
Using the Mapbox API, a set of coordinates are provide to the user. From there, a detailed forecast for those coordinates is provided via the Dark Sky API. The style is heavily influenced by pop art movement. The purpose is to give a viewer a small glimpse of how I create. Whether it’d be the process behind designing and developing the site. Perhaps, even creating the background from scratch in Adobe Illustrator. My goal is show my growth between my old and new portfolio. 

## How Use It
1. Type any location
2. Press Enter
3. Type the the provided latitude and longitude coordinates into the designated fields
4. Press the “Find Weather” button
